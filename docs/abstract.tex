\chapter*{\centering Abstract}
Summarize the entire thesis.
Be careful not to summarize the table of contents
(``in the methodology chapter we present our methods for ...'').
Rather, make the text self-standing, so that someone pressed
for time can read the abstract in place of the thesis.
So write, ``our methods involve extracting fault instances by
searching for ...''.

If your thesis is well-written most of the material can be derived
from the chapter introductions and conclusions.
There is absolutely no problem with the resulting duplication;
there is no need to paraphrase in order to avoid it.
