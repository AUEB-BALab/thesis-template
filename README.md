# PhD thesis template

This is a template for writing your PhD thesis.
It provides a common structure, but you may want to fine-tune it
according to the type of research you have performed.
In particular, consider changing the chapter titles to something
more specific, e.g. rather than “Background” write
“Existing work in testing ML pipelines”.

An alternative thesis style involves the so-called paper-stapling
thesis, which includes a number of published papers sandwiched
between an introduction chapter and a conclusions chapter.

Note that there is significant overlap between the introduction
and the conclusions.
This is by design.
Write the introduction in a forward looking style,
as if you are now beginning your PhD journey.
Write the conclusions in a retrospective style,
focusing on lessons learned.

In your writing please follow the
[advice for writing LaTeX documents](https://github.com/dspinellis/latex-advice).
